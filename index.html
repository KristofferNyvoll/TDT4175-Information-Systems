<h2 id="toc_3">1. An Introduction to Information System</h2>

<p>We live in an information economy. Information itself has real value, and in order to stay competitive, organizations require a steady flow of information about their business partners, competitors, customers, employees, markets, and suppliers. Information systems are increasingly being used to gather, store, digest, analyze, and make sense out of all this information</p>

<p><a name="chapter1.1"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_4">1.1 Data, Information, and knowledge</h3>

<p>To be an effective manager in any area of business, you need to understand that information is one of an organization’s most valuable resources. Information is not the same thing as data, and knowledge is different from both data and information. These concepts will now be explained.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Data&quot;</strong><br>
consists of raw facts, such as an employee number, total hours worked in a week, an inventory part number, or the number of units produced on a production line. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Information&quot;</strong><br>
is a collection of data organized and processed so that it has additional value beyond the facts themselves. For example, a sales manager may want individual sales data summarized so it shows the total sales for the month.<br>
Keywords: Input, Process, Output and Feedback.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Knowledge&quot;</strong><br>
is defined as awareness and understanding of a set of information and how that information can be put best to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Combining and converting data to useful information is called a <strong>process</strong>. A set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined outcome.
The process of defining relationships among data to create useful information requires knowledge. 
Information is essentially data made more useful through the application of knowledge.</p>

<p><a name="chapter1.2"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_5">1.2 The Value of Information</h3>

<p>The value of information is directly linked to how it helps decision makers achieve their organization’s goals. Fundamental to the quality of a decision is the quality of the information used to reach that decision. The importance of each of these characteristics varies depending on the situation and the kind of decision you are trying to make.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">1.3 Information Systems</h3>

<p>We say that an <strong>information system (IS)</strong> is a set of interrelated components that collect, manipulate and process data into information, as well as providing feedback; </p>

<p><img src="img/Skjermbilde%202018-12-11%20kl.%2015.36.45.png" alt="components of an IS"></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An information System assembles, stores,
processes and delivers information relevant to an organisation (or to society), in such a way that the information is accessible and useful to those who wish to use it, including managers, staff, clients and citizens. An information system is a human activity (social) system which may or may not involve the use of computer systems. </p>

<p>(Buckingham et al., 1987).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="toc_7">Feedback</h4>

<p>An information system provides a feedback mechanism to monitor and control its operation to make sure it continues to meet its goals and objectives.<br>
The feedback mechanism is critical to helping organizations achieve their goals, such as increasing profits or improving customer service.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">1.4 Types of Information Systems</h3>

<p>Information systems can be manual or computer based (<strong>CBIS</strong>).<br>
Businesses can use IS to increase revenues and reduce costs, solve problems and make decisions. An organization’s <strong>technology infrastructure</strong> includes all the hardware, software, databases, networks, people, and procedures that are configured to collect, manipulate, store, and process data into information. The technology infrastructure is a set of shared IS resources that form the foundation of each computer-based infor- mation system.</p>

<p>Using a CBIS involves setting and following many <strong>procedures</strong> <em>(a set of steps that need to be followed to achieve a specific end result)</em> including those for the operation, maintenance, and security of the system.<br>
Good procedures can help companies take advantage of new opportunities and avoid lengthy business disruptions in the event of natural disasters. Poorly developed and inadequately implemented procedures, however, can cause people to waste their time on useless rules or result in inadequate responses to disasters.</p>

<p><strong>The three types:</strong><br>
Most organizations have a number of different information systems. When considering the role of business managers in working with IS, it is useful to divide information systems into three types;</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">2 Information Systems in Organizations</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Organization&quot;</strong><br>
An organization is a group of people that is structured and managed to meet its mission or set of group goals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Organizations are considered to be open systems, meaning that they affect and are affected by their surrounding environment. Providing value to a stakeholder (customer, supplier, partner, shareholder, or employee) is the primary goal of any organization.</p>

<p>Within an organization, information systems
are developed, or re-developed,
with the aim to support value addition. Cost reduction, productivity and competitive advantage are some of the motivations.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">2.1 Porters &quot;5 Powers&quot; Model</h3>

<p>Porters five powers is used to help <a href="#chapter7.1">analysing</a> the nature of competition within an industry. It helps us understand and assess the industries profitability and attractiveness.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The threat of new competitors</strong> will raise the level of competition. Entry barriers determine the relative threat of new competitors. These barriers include the capital required to enter the industry and the cost to custo- mers to switch to a competitor.</li>
<li><strong>The bargaining power of buyers</strong> determines prices and long-term profit- ability. This bargaining power is stronger when there are relatively few buyers but many sellers in the industry, or when the products offered are all essentially the same.</li>
<li><strong>The threat of substitute products</strong> can lower the profitability of industry competitors. The willingness of buyers to switch products and the relative cost and performance of substitutes are key factors in this threat.</li>
<li><strong>The bargaining power of suppliers</strong> can significantly affect the industry’s profitability. Suppliers have strong bargaining power in industries that have many buyers and only a few dominant suppliers and in industries that do not represent a key customer group for suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>The degree of rivalry</strong> between competitors is high in industries with many equally sized competitors or little differentiation between products.</li>

<h3 id="toc_31">4.7 Knowledge-based DSS</h3>

<p>Knowledge-based decision support systems are systems designed to ensure more precise decision-making by effectively using timely and appropriate data, information, and knowledge management for convergence industry. These systems refer to decision-making based on relevant knowledge, which is based on artificial intelligence, and on the application of information and communication technologies.
<img src="img/Skjermbilde%202018-12-12%20kl.%2017.46.55.png" alt=""></p>

<h4 id="toc_32">Rule based decisions:</h4>

<p>The collection of rules that contribute to a “decision”
can be structured as a decision tree. The tree is simply a representation of a collection of rules.
<img src="img/Skjermbilde%202018-12-12%20kl.%2017.53.09.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The rules can also be represented using a table.<br>
This table represents the exact same rules as the decision tree does, in the same order.
<img src="img/Skjermbilde%202018-12-12%20kl.%2017.55.26.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Problems with Rules</strong><br>
• Fail to work if a problem is not anticipated by rules.<br>
• Can interact in complex ways.<br>
• Huge rule sets are difficult to maintain<br>
• Are not flexible (contextualizable) </p>

<h4 id="toc_33">Case based decisions:</h4>

<p>In CBR “knowledge” is held in a case base of real prior problems and their solutions.</p>

<p>e.g.
Case-based diagnosis is common:<br>
• physician matches new case with one seen
previously and uses the diagnosis of the old case
as a starting point.
<img src="img/Skjermbilde%202018-12-12%20kl.%2017.59.59.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Benefits of CBR</strong><br>
• May work better than rule-based or modelbasedfor natural domains.<br>
• Does not require extensive analysis of domainknowledge.<br>
• Existing data and knowledge - case histories,repair logs - are leveraged.<br>
• Shortcuts complex reasoning - may be quicker than rule-based or model-based.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with CBR</strong><br>
<ul>
<li> Lack of deep knowledge<br>
    – poor explanation<br>
    – danger of misapplication of cases.<br>
<li> Large case base can slow things down<br>
– (compute-store tradeoff)
<li> Knowledge engineering can still be arduous<br>
– designing and selecting features<br>
– similarity matching algorithms
</ul></p>

<h3 id="toc_34">4.8 Executive Support Systems (ESS)</h3>

<p>Special case of DSS, designed to support higher-level decisions (strategic planning)</p>

<p><a name="chapter4.9"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_35">4.9 Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS)</h3>

<p>Is an interactive computer based system that facilitates a number of decision-makers (working together in a group) in finding solutions to problems that are unstructured in nature. They are designed in such a way that they take input from multiple users interacting simultaneously with the systems to arrive at a decision as a group.</p>

<p>Consists of most DSS elements + software for providing group support</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics of a GDSS That Enhance Decision Making:</strong><br>
• Anonymous input<br>
• Reduction of negative group behavior<br>
• Parallel and unified communication<br>
• Automated record keeping  </p>

<h2 id="toc_38">5 Modeling of Information Systems</h2>

<p>Models are highlights of the essentials of (part of) reality. They are quicker and cheaper to make than the full artifact, but still similar, so that it is often possible to spot
consequences of decisions.<br>
Models are important for producing more innovative results of better quality, and provide risk-free (although not effort-free) testing of:<br>
    - what-if scenarios<br>
    - accident simulation </p>

<p>The main reason to develop an Enterprise Architecture is to get an overview of data flow and ISs, and to identify possible economic gains in the various process steps in the business.  </p>

<p>Two problems were addressed by the field of Enterprise Architecture
when it was established: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>System complexity:</strong>  organiszations were spending more and more money on building IT systems<br></li>
<li><strong>Poor business alignment:</strong>  organizations were finding it more and more difficult to keep those expensive IT systems aligned with business needs</li>

<p>The Zachman Framework is not a methodology because it does not specify methods for collecting and managing the information it describes. It is rather an ontology; a schema for organizing architectural artifacts.</p>

<h3 id="toc_44">6.3 Enterprise Architecture Modeling</h3>

<h4 id="toc_45">ArchiMate</h4>

<p>Is an enterprise architecture modeling language. It supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within business domains in an unambiguous(<em>not open to more than one interpretation</em>) way. It distinguishes itself from other languages, (UML) and (BPMN), by its enterprise modelling scope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Enterprise Modelling Scope&quot;</strong>
abstract representation, description and definition of the structure, processes, information and resources of an identifiable business, government body, or other large organization.</p>

<h2 id="toc_46">7 Strategic Planning</h2>

<p>Strategic planning is a process that helps managers identify desired outcomes and formulate feasible plans to achieve their objectives by using available resources and capabilities. The strategic plan must take into account that the organization and everything around it is changing..</p>

<p><strong>The following is a set of frequently cited benefits of strategic planning:</strong><br>
• Provides a framework and a clearly defined direction to guide decision making at all levels throughout the organization<br>
• Ensures the most effective use is made of the organization’s resources by focusing those resources on agreed-on key priorities
• Enables the organization to be proactive and take advantage of opportunities and trends, rather than passively reacting to them<br>
• Enables all organizational units to participate and work together toward accomplishing a common set of goals<br>
• Provides a set of measures for judging organizational and personnel performance<br>
• Improves communication among management and the board of directors, shareholders, and other interested parties</p>

<h3 id="toc_47">7.1 Analyze Situation</h3>

<p>All levels and business units of an organization must be involved in assessing its strengths and weaknesses. A multitude of data is gathered about internal processes and operations, including survey data from customers and suppliers and other objective assessments of the organization. The collected data is analyzed to identify and assess how well the firm is meeting current objectives and goals, and how well its current strategies are working.</p>

<p>The most frequently used model for assessing the nature of industry competition is Michael <a href="#chapter2.1">Porter’s Five Forces Model</a>, which identifies the funda- mental factors that determine the level of competition and long-term profitability of an industry </p>

<p><a name="chapter7.2"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_48">7.2 Set Direction</h3>

<p>The direction-setting phase of strategic planning involves defining the mis- sion, vision, values, objectives, and goals of the organization.</p>

<p><a name="chapter7.3"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_49">7.3 Define Strategies</h3>

<p>A strategy describes how an organization will achieve its vision, mission, objectives, and goals.</p>

<p><a name="chapter7.4"></a></p>

<h3 id="toc_50">7.4 Deploy Plan</h3>

<p>The strategic plan defines objectives for an organization, establishes SMART goals, and sets strategies on how to reach those goals. These objectives, goals, and strategies are then communicated to the organization’s business units and functional units so that everyone is “on the same page.” The managers of the various organizational units can then develop more detailed plans for initiatives, programs, and projects that align with the firm’s objectives, goals, and strategies.</p>
